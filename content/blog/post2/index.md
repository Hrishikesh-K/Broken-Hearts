I've been plagued with acne since secondary school days. Fast forward 13 years, I was still having occasional acne outbreak but nothing as serious as a canvas full of cystic acne. I experimented with countless products that promised me clear, blemish-free and healthy looking skin. From dabbing my outbreaks with tea tree oil, concocting my own blend of homemade mask (egg white, egg yolk, oatmeal with honey, yogurt, etc.), nothing seems to solve it. The effects were only temporary. My skin cleared up after a while, yet acne recurred after I've stopped.

Fighting acne is truly exhausting… I'm not a bad person. It's not what I should have deserved…

I've shed many tears about my acne skin that I felt I was the ugliest girl on earth… at one time real hard for old acne scars to eventually fade.

You know, the first thing people look at and talk about, is your face. I've realized my acne has gradually become a conversation piece for my friends, every single aunty who came with her own remedy, even acquaintances.

You go round in circles, if you have moderate scarring and are living a normal life, my advice would be to do NOTHING. Avoid getting into the loop because, once you are in, you'll never escape.

Treatments can help somewhat, but, you will never get the result you want, the deeper you go, the bigger the risks. You may make your scars better by % but the aggressive lasers destroy your skin tone and cause acne breakouts, cause fat loss, cause pigmentation issues or cause more scarring. Then you have to treat these problems and it just never ends.

I've been called a lot of names, literally ignored and ragged endlessly, fast forward to now, it's all different.

Don't judge a book by its cover.

In the meantime your mental well being gets destroyed as you get your hopes up for every treatment. Maybe the swelling makes your skin look better for 2 weeks and you are full of confidence only to be dragged back into depression when the swelling goes away.

All I want to say is,
Let nature takes its course and as Alessia Cara says,
These are just scars to your beautiful.

Have a nice day!
