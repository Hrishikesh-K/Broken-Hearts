'Ananya' literally means unique and I think I am pretty extraordinary. I love creating, traveling and experimenting. I'm a bold energetic, hardworking and dramatic storyteller. I paint a picture with my words. With a natural ability to lead, I am inspired by my surroundings and live to bring the 'X' factor to the table. Performing best under pressure, my work style is kinesthetic like a piece of coal that converts into a diamond under high pressure. Pursuing a career in advertising, I believe that I am paid to think of convincing people to buy things that they didn't even know they needed, basically I can sell ice to a polar bear. Following the motto 'Life is too short' I take the plunge and am not afraid to get my hands dirty because if not now, then when?
